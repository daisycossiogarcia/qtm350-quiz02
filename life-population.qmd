## Analysis of Life Expectancy vs. Population

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
gapminder = pd.read_csv('gapminder.csv')
sns.scatterplot(data=gapminder, x='population_millions', y='life_expectancy', hue='continent')
plt.title('Life Expectancy vs. Population')
plt.xlabel('Population (millions)')
plt.ylabel('Life Expectancy')
plt.show()
```

What you see here is that regardless of population between 0 to 200 the life expectiancy varies. As population increases beyond 400, only Asia is being depicted and as population increases life esxpectancy is also showing positive growing trend for Asia.
