## Analysis of Life Expectancy vs. GDP per Capita

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

gapminder = pd.read_csv('gapminder.csv')
sns.scatterplot(data=gapminder, x='gdp_per_capita', y='life_expectancy', hue='continent')
plt.title('Life Expectancy vs. GDP per Capita')
plt.xlabel('GDP per Capita')
plt.ylabel('Life Expectancy')
plt.show()
```

What you see here is that across many contients that the life expectancy tend to curve out in the high pertanges between 80-70% near the 0 to 40000 mark of GDP per Capita. As GDP per Capita increases we only see Asia being depicted and gradually showing a negative trend.
